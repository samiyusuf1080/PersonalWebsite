    <div class = "Body">
        <p> I was able to make a basic CPU using Verilog for one of my classes. I gained insight on the internal structure of modern computers and systems while also becoming more comfortable with Verilog and assembly language.
            Below is the datapath that the CPU was modelled after.

        <h3><b>Yemen Crisis Webpage</b></h3>
    </div>

    <div class = "Body">
        <p> I decided to make this webpage for two reasons: bring attention to a humanitarian crisis that is dear to my community and learn basic webpage architecture.
            The website is a static webpage that offers the user information regarding the crisis and recent news on it. It also offers links that users can navigate to in order to help in way of donations or signing petitions.
            I was able to attain a basic understanding of HTML/CSS as a result of this project. Unfortunately, I don't have this project any longer as it was deleted off my computer without backing up.
            Feel free to learn more about the crisis by clicking <a href = "https://www.unicef.org/emergencies/yemen-crisis" target="_blank">here</a>.
        </p>

    <div class = "Body">
        <p>Going forward, I look to embark on new projects that force me to learn about new technologies that are relevant in the industry.
            I will also work on improving this website and keeping it updated as well!
