      <p>I am a Junior Computer Engineering major at <a href = "https://www.tamu.edu/" target="_blank"> Texas A&M Univeristy </a> based out of Houston, Texas.</p>
      <p>Despite my major, my relationship with coding and software hasn't always been smooth. My first experience with coding was by way of AP Computer Science in highschool.
          Although I tried my best in the class, something just didn't click as I found myself struggling to keep up with the material and losing interest. As a result of this, I entered Texas A&M as a biomedical engineer as I had no interest in software related majors.
          Fortunatly for me, my first semester of university, I took a mandatory Introduction to Python course. I remember being captivated by the different projects and assignments; and as a result, I learned alot while enjoying myself too.
          I did my research, asked people in the field for advice, and decided to apply to become a Computer Engineer with a focus on Computer Science. I'm happy to say that I haven't looked back since! :)
      </p>
      <p>I am currently pursuing a career in software development as I am intrigued by how seemingly meaningless words on a screen can have such a massive impact on the world around us and how we interact with it.
          Right now I am currently looking for an internship opportunity for the summer of 2022 to further expand my knowledge of the field and cultivate useful skills for future endeavors.
      </p>
      <p>My hobbies and interests outside of school and work contain:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Exploring new cuisines and trying new, local restaurants.</li>
          <li>Playing team sports such as volleyball, basketball, and soccer in a friendly or competitive format.</li>
          <li>Attempting all sorts of puzzles, whether they be jigsaw, crossword, or anything in between. (I'm really enjoying <a href = "https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/">Wordle</a> right now.) </li>
          <li>Watching anime on a lazy day (My favorites are One Piece, Naruto, and Attack on Titan).</li>
          <li>Going to the gym to clear my head and organize my thoughts.</li>
          <li>Watching and keeping up with my <a href = "https://www.chelseafc.com/en" target="_blank">favorite soccer team</a> and players.</li>
      </ul>
