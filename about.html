      <hr class = "featurette-divider">
      <p class = "lead">I am a Junior Computer Engineering major at <a href = "https://www.tamu.edu/" target="_blank" style = "color:darkred"> Texas A&M Univeristy </a> based out of Houston, Texas.</p>
      <p class = "lead">Despite my major, my relationship with coding and software hasn't always been smooth. My first experience with coding was by way of AP Computer Science in highschool.
          Although I tried my best in the class, something just didn't click as I found myself struggling to keep up with the material and losing interest. As a result of this, I entered Texas A&M as a biomedical engineer as I had no interest in software related majors.
          Fortunatly for me, my first semester of university, I took a mandatory Introduction to Python course. I remember being captivated by the different projects and assignments; and as a result, I learned alot while enjoying myself too.
          I did my research, asked people in the field for advice, and decided to apply to become a Computer Engineer with a focus on Computer Science. I'm happy to say that I haven't looked back since! :)
      </p>
      <p class = "lead">I am currently pursuing a career in software development as I am intrigued by how seemingly meaningless words on a screen can have such a massive impact on the world around us and how we interact with it.
          Right now I am currently looking for a full-time opportunity as I am expecting to graduate in the spring of 2023.
